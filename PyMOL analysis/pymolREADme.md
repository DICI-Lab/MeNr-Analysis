**SCRIPT & STRUCTURES INFORMATION**

The PyMOL script was executed on The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 3.1.3 by Schrödinger, LLC.

**Run the script with structures**
The structures (named: `VL9-LIL`, `VL9_LFL`, `HSP60`, `HCVcore`, `ENV6`, `GAG371`, `ENV800`, `ENV804`, `ENV818T`, `GAG146`, `GAG276`, `POL280`) can be found in the repository "PyMOL analysis" folder -> "ModelsUsed_Sum" folder -> "peptideMamuE0211pocket" or "peptideMamuE0220pocket" folders. 

The script "Script_RMSDresidueREF.py" can be used for `VL9-LIL`, `VL9_LFL` as an example. If more structures or other structure need to be analyzed. Please add name structure in the #VAR# line (ref. READme file instruction).
